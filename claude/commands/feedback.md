Look for comments I added in change `$1`.  Please answer each question I ask (one at a time), and once we're through the questions, go through the reminaing pieces of feedback and address them (also one at a time), asking for clarification whenever you need to.  Defend your decisions - feel free to push back if you feel you have good cause/reasons for decisions I'm calling into question.
